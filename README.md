## Contributing

### - "Can I help with code changes, do you accept PRs, etc?"

Currently, absolutely **NOT**.

The current code and project is intended as and experiment and an exercise
for my own amusement.
I intend to keep full copyright powers over it for the time being, so not
accepting any code changes from anyone since I also don't want to deal with
any CLA things.

### - "Do you accept issues or any other kind of comments?"

Also, **NO**. Similar reasons as above, anything pertaining to trying to contribute
will be ignored.
